    Testing showed that with a delay of 0.1 seconds, we would see a drop after every 
    16th message. This was resolved with a 0.2 second delay, so we are using 0.5 seconds 
    in our application to be safe.
    
    Other notes:
        - Performance was worse when sitting in the car than when just in the garage view.
        - We moved the delay until after the chat command was sent, which seemed to help.
